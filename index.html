    <h1>What makes swimming so difficult?</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      Why is swimming so difficult? It looks easy on the TV, but whenever you
      try to do it, you don't go nearly as fast. I'm Stone, and I chose this as
      my question for Genius Hour.
    </p>

    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to figure out how a sport I partake in a lot is challenging, both
      so I can relate, and so I can see it from other people's perspectives. I
      want to know the physical and mental challenges of swimming, and why
      people shy away from the competitiveness and sport of it. I have been
      swimming competitively since the age of 9 and have been learning since I
      was 11 months old. The rest of my family are not as focused on swimming,
      and some of them have been trying to learn recently. I want to see the
      difficulties they are going through. as well as the ones I went through
      when I initially started. This project will teach me and others about the
      difficulties, both physically and mentally, in this sport.
    </p>
    <h2>What I Hope to learn</h2>
    <p>
      From my research, I hope to better grasp the challenges of my favorite
      sport. I found it hard to find good sources, for difficulties are
      opinionated. It was an added challenge towards figuring out what truly
      makes swimming challenging, but I think that the majority of beliefs lies
      in my findings.
    </p>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <p>
      I used many sources, the most helpful being the
      <a
        href="https://www.traindaly.com/train-daly/blog/is-swimming-the-hardest-sport"
        >Traindaly blog post</a

        >competitor&reg; article about mental challenges</a
      >. look at <a href="sources.html">sources</a> for more details.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>
      I used paper notes with bullet points to take my notes. It helped keep my
      notes concise and focus on only the important things. It turns out
      swimming is difficult for a multitude of reasons. Mental reasons include
      anxiety aned fear of failure pre-race, spoken about in the Competitor&reg;
      article, and highs and lows from swim meets, which can cause mental
      instability, spoken about in the Olympic article. Some physical
      difficulties are a transition from air to water, swimming being a full
      body sport, and the technique needed, a result of there being four
      strokes. This is discussed in the Traindaly article.
    </p>
    <h3>Mental Difficulties</h3>
    <p>
      Fear of failure and anxiety pre-race provide an extra hurdle towards
      dropping time. they are a distraction and swimmers must push through it.
      Highs and lows, as seen in the Olympic article, can damage a swimmers'
      mental health. Michael Phelps got post-Olympic depression as a result,
      which is on the more extreme end.
    </p>
    <h3>Physical Difficulties</h3>
    <p>
      Another difficulty I found is the different enviroment, explained in the
      Traindaly article. Because swimming is in water, which is 800 times more
      dense than air, there is a lot more physical resistance than any other
      sport. Your body is not used to it, so it is hard to move. Being in water
      also forces controlled breathing, which is not required in most sports. It
      makes the sport a lot more difficult, as the Traindaly article details.
      Unlike many other sports, swimming is full body. Swimmers need to be in
      peak condition in all areas to get a fast time, which is extremely
      difficult. It makes swimming "one of the most complete forms of exercise,
      but also one of the most demanding." (Traindaly article). The technique
      needed for swimming is really difficult to master. Swimming "requires
      near-perfect efficiency to move effectively through the water." (Traindaly
      article). Unlike most sports, a lack of technique will cause failure to a
      very large extent. This is a major difficulty, especially considering that
      there are 4 different strokes, each with their own techniques. As the
      article notes, it is almost like 4 different sports.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Swimmers Stop Swimming Competitively</h3>
    <p>
      From the article related to why swimmers leave the sport, it explains many
      reasons for swimmers quitting, such as pushy parents and coaches, and a
      lack of social life. Swimmers can recieve a lot of pressure from their
      coaches and parents. This is probably the main reason swimmers quit. I
      have gone through this and I know many people who have. It inverts a
      swimmer's feeling of the sport, causing them to hate it. Parents could
      push their kid too far. They could make their child go to practices they
      do not want to go to. Coaches can push swimmers too far similarly to
      parents, and prevent them from learning from any other source. Parents and
      coaches are very important towards a swimmer's success, but they can also
      influence them negatively. Moreover, swimming can limit the rest of a
      person's life. Swimming is very time consuming. The article says, "
      committed swimmers often find the biggest draw to the sport is the social
      circle it comes with." Swimming forces a swimmer to be friends with the
      people they swim with, or if they have other friends, it makes them have a
      very limited time socially. It makes it harder to try different hobbies.
      another reason which is pretty obvious, yet not talked about in the
      article, is that people like another activity more or just don't like
      swimming. Ms.Baldwin, my teacher, said, "I like swimming, but there's
      other things I like more." This is a common reason for not liking a sport.
    </p>
    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p>
      I expected this project to take a pretty long time. I needed to learn a
      lot of thingsto make this, most of which should take a lot longer than
      they did. I wanted to finish the two parts by the end of the week, then
      polish them. It went a lot quicker than expected.
    </p>
    <h2>Successes</h2>
    <p>
      I believe I succeeded in multiple areas. I figured out why people quit
      swimming, and why swimming is difficult both physically and mentally. I
      was surprised how I could not find why people prefer recreational swimming
      instead of competitive swimming, but that is obviously an opinion and can
      be inferenced from the difficulties.
    </p>
    <h2>Difficulties</h2>
    <p>
      It was hard to find a source that directly answered the question to why
      people shy away from competitive swimming. I used a lot of reasoning and
      my own experiences to figure out what the answer would be
    </p>
    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      I would say this project was mostly successful. I did well finding sources
      and answers to my questions , and managed my time well. I would give this
      project a 4 out of 5 because the questions were kind of subjective.
    </p>
    <h2>Final Words</h2>
    <p>
      The most important thing I learned throughout this experience is to not
      judge people because they are different from me. People have their reasons
      for not swimming, and that is okay. If I had to do this project again, I
      would do it on how speed makes people feel good, which occurs during
      rollercoasters, water slides, running, biking, and in other areas.
