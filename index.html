    <H1> What makes swimming so difficult?</H1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Why is swimming so difficult? It looks easy on the TV, but whenever you try to do it, you don't go nearly as fast.
        I'm Stone, and I chose this as my question for Genius Hour.
    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
    I wanted to figure out how a sport I partake in a lot is challenging, both so I can relate, and so I can see it
    from other people's perspectives. I want to know the physical and mental challenges of swimming,
    and why people shy away from the competitiveness and sport of it. I have been swimming competitively since the age of 9 
    and have been learning since I was 11 months old. The rest of my family are not as focused on swimming, 
    and some of them have been trying to learn recently. I want to see the difficulties they are going through. as well 
    as the ones I went through when I initially started. This project will teach me and others about the difficulties, 
    both physically and mentally, in this sport. </p>
    <h2>What I Hope to learn</h2>
    <p>
    From my research, I hope to better grasp the challenges of my favorite sport. I found it hard to find good sources, 
    for difficulties are opinionated. It was an added challenge towards figuring out what truly makes swimming challenging,
    but I think that the majority of beliefs lies in my findings. </p>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
      <p>  I used many sources, the most helpful being the <a href="https://www.traindaly.com/train-daly/blog/is-swimming-the-hardest-sport">Traindaly blog post</a>.
        There was also an <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/23-time-gold-medallist-michael-phelps-opens-up-on-post-olympic-depression">Olympic Article</a>
        reflecting on Michael Phelps' post-Olympic depression, an <a href="https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/7-familiar-reasons-why-swimmers-leave-the-sport/">
            Magazine post discussing reasonsv why swimmers quit</a>,
        and a <a href="https://www.competitorswim.com/the-psychology-of-competitive-swimming-overcoming-anxiety-and-building-confidence/">competitor&reg; article about mental challenges</a>.
        look at <a href="sources.html">sources</a> for more details. <p>
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p> 
           I used paper notes with bullet points to take my notes. It helped keep my notes concise and focus on only the important things.
        It turns out swimming is difficult for a multitude of reasons. Mental reasons include anxiety aned fear of failure pre-race, spoken about in the Competitor&reg; article,
         and highs and lows from swim meets, which can cause mental instability, spoken about in the Olympic article. Some physical difficulties are a transition from air to water, swimming being a full body sport, 
         and the technique needed, a result of there being four strokes. This is discussed in the Traindaly article. 


    </p>
    <h3>Mental Difficulties</h3>
    <p>Fear of failure and anxiety pre-race provide an extra hurdle  towards dropping time. they are a distraction and swimmers must push through it. 
        Highs and lows, as seen in the Olympic article, can damage a swimmers' mental health. Michael Phelps got post-Olympic depression as a result, which is on the more extreme end.
    </p>
    <h3>Physical Difficulties</h3>
    <p>Another difficulty I found is the different enviroment, explained in the Traindaly article.
        Because swimming is in water, which is 800 times more dense than air, there is a lot more physical resistance than any other sport.
        Your body is not used to it, so it is hard to move. Being in water also forces controlled breathing, which is not required in most sports.
        It makes the sport a lot more difficult, as the Traindaly article details.
        Unlike many other sports, swimming is full body. Swimmers need to be in peak condition in all areas to get a fast time, which is extremely difficult. It makes swimming "one of the most complete forms of exercise, but also one of the most demanding." (Traindaly article).

    <h2>Time</h2>

    <h2>Successes</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Difficulties</h2>
    <p>It was hard to find a source that directly answered the question to why people shy away from competitive swimming. I used a lot of reasoning
         and my own experiences to figure out what the answer would be</p>
    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>I would say this project was mostlyb successful. I did well finding sources and answers to my questions, and managed my time well. I would give this project a 4 out of 5 because the questions were kind of  </p>
